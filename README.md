## 🧭 About Me

I’m currently studying at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).  
My main focus is on data science and applied machine learning — including statistical modeling, data engineering, and algorithm development.

I enjoy working on projects that turn raw data into insights and build systems that learn, predict, and scale 📊
